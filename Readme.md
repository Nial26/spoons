## Current Spoons

### Screenpush

Pushes an Image that is currently on the clipboard to imgur      

#### Config Required

`IMGUR_CLIENT_ID` : One way to find this, if you don't want to create an account in Imgur is to go to imgur and upload a image, and in the network tab you'll find `client_id` as a query param in the upload requests

#### Quick Install

- After Adding the Spoon add, the following to your config file

```
hs.spoons.use('Screenpush', {
    config = {
        IMGUR_CLIENT_ID = '<some-imgur-client-id>'
    },
    hotkeys = {Screenpush = {{"cmd", "shift"}, "/"}},
})
```
